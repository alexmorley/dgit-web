Decentralised Git Repo Sharing/Storage backed by Dat 

So. Github have [gone rogue](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/06/04/microsoft-github-empowering-developers/). Ok, not quite, and the way I see it, it was either they got bought-out or shut-down, and I'm glad it was the former. Whatever your feelings on the above may be, it'd be nice to have a full **free**, **open** and **decentralised** place to collaborate on software, and other projects.
