Decentralised Git Repo Sharing/Storage backed by Dat 

So. Github have [gone rogue](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/06/04/microsoft-github-empowering-developers/). Ok, not quite, and the way I see it, it was either they got bought-out or shut-down, and I'm glad it was the former. Whatever your feelings on the above may be, it'd be nice to have a full **free**, **open** and **decentralised** place to collaborate on software, and other projects.

So... let's build it? Or have you already started? Fork [this page on github](https://github.com/alexmorley/dgit-web) or using [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/) and add your name below plus answers to any of the questions.


## Current Architecture Proposal
- Git remote sharing over hyperdrive / dat
- Core Repository "Portal" on dat (mirrored to http)

## Work in this area
- [hyperdb git repo](https://github.com/noffle/hyperdb-git-repo)
- [hyperdb git remote helper](https://github.com/noffle/git-remote-hypergit)
- [hypergit](https://github.com/noffle/hypergit)
- [GitTorrent](https://github.com/cjb/GitTorrent)

## Research

**Current Open Source Git repository browsers**
- [GitWeb](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/tree/gitweb)
- [Gitiles](https://github.com/google/gitiles)

**What do we want from a code-sharing platform?**
- Searchability - should be able to search through all repos by tag/name/content
- ?? Community Input - Portal for bug-reports. Some metric for community approval e.g. how many other people are using this, and what do they think .

**What do we not want?**
- ??
