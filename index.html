<p>Decentralised Git Repo Sharing/Storage backed by Dat</p>
<p>So. Github have <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/06/04/microsoft-github-empowering-developers/">gone rogue</a>. Ok, not quite, and the way I see it, it was either they got bought-out or shut-down, and I'm glad it was the former. Whatever your feelings on the above may be, it'd be nice to have a full <strong>free</strong>, <strong>open</strong> and <strong>decentralised</strong> place to collaborate on software, and other projects.</p>
<p>So... let's build it? Or have you already started? Fork <a href="https://github.com/alexmorley/dgit-web">this page on github</a> or using <a href="https://beakerbrowser.com/">Beaker Browser</a> and add your name below plus answers to any of the questions.</p>

<ul>
<li>Git remote sharing over hyperdrive / dat</li>
<li>Core Repository &quot;Portal&quot; on dat (mirrored to http)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Current Open Source Git repository browsers</strong> - <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/tree/gitweb">GitWeb</a> - <a href="https://github.com/google/gitiles">Gitiles</a></p>
<p><strong>What do we want from a code-sharing platform?</strong> - Searchability - should be able to search through all repos by tag/name/content - ?? Community Input - Portal for bug-reports. Some metric for community approval e.g. how many other people are using this, and what do they think .</p>
<p><strong>What do we not want?</strong> - ??</p>
